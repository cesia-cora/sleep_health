# Sleep Health Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning models and Python analysis scripts based on [Sleep Health Lifestyle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset). The goal of this project is to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to understand and predict various aspects of sleep quality and its impacts on health.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scripts for collecting and preprocessing a dataset from Kaggle.
- **Model Training**: Scripts for training machine learning models on sleep data.
- **Analysis**: Tools for analyzing the results and extracting insights about sleep patterns and their health implications.
- **Visualization**: Plots to visualize sleep trends and model predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
